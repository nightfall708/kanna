/**
 * Tracks, per project, whether the working tree is dirty and roughly when that
 * started — the input to the sidebar's "this chat is relevant to your
 * uncommitted work" dot (`lastTurnEndedAt > dirtySinceMs`) — plus the repo name
 * and branch behind the sidebar's `repo/branch` label.
 *
 * Entirely in-memory and derived: nothing is persisted, so a restart just
 * repopulates lazily. Reads are synchronous because the sidebar snapshot
 * builder can't await git.
 *
 * Three update paths, none of which sweeps `git status` across projects:
 *
 * 1. **Turn end** (`refreshForProject`) — the only event that both dirties a
 *    tree and advances `lastTurnEndedAt`, so the only one that can *create* a
 *    dot. One `git status` for one project.
 * 2. **The tick** (`start`) — stats `<gitDir>/index` and `<gitDir>/HEAD` per
 *    project and runs the real probe only when that stamp changed. A commit
 *    always rewrites the index and a checkout rewrites HEAD, so this catches
 *    the case that leaves dots stale: committing outside Kanna. At idle it
 *    spawns zero processes.
 * 3. **`DiffStore.onWorkingTreeProbe`** — free; `performRefresh` already stats
 *    every dirty file. Keeps the client's active project current and clears the
 *    dot immediately when a commit goes through Kanna's git panel.
 *
 * A plain hand edit touches no git metadata and so is missed by (2), but under
 * the dot's rule a hand edit moves `dirtySinceMs` to *now*, which can only
 * remove dots from chats whose turns predate it — never add a wrong one.
 *
 * Repo labels ride along on the same passes but cover *every* project with a
 * live chat, not just the dot candidates: the label is on screen for all of
 * them. They're cheap enough to afford that — the repo root comes from the
 * already-cached location, and the branch is one read of `<gitDir>/HEAD`
 * rather than a `git` subprocess. HEAD is half the stamp, so a checkout
 * anywhere already wakes the tick that re-reads it.
