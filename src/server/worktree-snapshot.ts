/**
 * Which files a chat actually changed, by snapshotting the working tree at each
 * turn boundary and diffing the two trees.
 *
 * The point is to answer "did this chat touch anything that's still
 * uncommitted?" without a clock. The old answer compared the chat's last turn
 * end against a per-project "when did the tree get dirty" timestamp, which is a
 * proxy for authorship rather than a measurement of it: one file left
 * uncommitted overnight flagged every chat that had run since, and none of them
 * had necessarily touched it.
 *
 * Snapshots measure the filesystem, so they don't care *how* a file changed —
 * an Edit tool, `sed -i` inside a Bash call, a formatter on save, or a subagent
 * all land in the diff identically. Parsing tool calls would see only the first.
 *
 * The trees are written with `git write-tree` against a throwaway index, so the
 * user's index is never touched and nothing is committed, staged, or moved. No
 * refs are created either: we need the tree only long enough to diff it, and
 * loose objects are not pruned anywhere near that fast. (If per-chat diffs or
 * turn-level revert ever want the trees kept, add refs then — the recorded
 * paths don't change.)
 *
 * Each recorded path carries the blob it held in `HEAD` when the turn *started*
 * — the committed content the turn's edit was made on top of. That's what
 * expires a claim: once anyone commits the path, `HEAD` no longer holds that
 * blob and the chat stops being relevant to it, without any clock being
 * involved. Turn *start* rather than turn end, because agents routinely commit
 * their own work mid-turn — a base read afterwards would be the chat's own
 * commit and would keep the chat alive on work it had already landed.
