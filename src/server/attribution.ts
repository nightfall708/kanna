/**
 * Kanna's git attribution — one source of truth for two very different surfaces.
 *
 * Harness commits (advisory): buildKannaAttributionInstructions is appended to
 * each provider's system prompt — natively for claude (systemPrompt.append), pi
 * (DefaultResourceLoader.appendSystemPrompt) and codex
 * (collaborationMode.settings.developer_instructions). Cursor assembles its
 * prompt server-side and exposes no append hook, so it rides the same user-text
 * <system-message> path the skill failsafe uses. All four are instructions to a
 * model: compliance is high but not guaranteed.
 *
 * Kanna's own commits (deterministic): buildKannaCommitAttribution is applied in
 * diff-store.commitFiles just before git runs, so anything committed from the
 * git sidebar is attributed by construction, not by persuasion. Those carry no
 * agent trailer — no agent ran.
 *
 * The agent id is baked into the instructions, so it costs nothing per turn.
 * Codex and cursor rebuild theirs every turn and are always current. Claude and
 * pi bake theirs at session start and drift when setModel() swaps the model on
 * a live session, so those two append buildKannaAgentCorrection to the turn
 * text from the drift onward — a bare value, because the rule is already in
 * their (cached) system prompt.
 *
 * Note the link is markdown in PR bodies and a bare URL in commits: GitHub
 * renders markdown in PR descriptions, but commit messages are plain text
 * everywhere — bare URLs autolink, `[text](url)` would show up literally.
