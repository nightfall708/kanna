/**
 * How the New Sidebar names a project — the trailing label on Chats-tab rows

 *
 * Precedence is "most specific thing the user asked for" first:
 *
 * 1. A rename wins outright. If you named it, that's the name — and no branch
 *    is flagged on it, since the name you chose is the whole label.
 * 2. Otherwise the repo name, flagged with its branch when the branch is a
 *    surprise. The repo root's name is not always the project's folder name (a
 *    project can be a subdirectory of its repo).
 * 3. Otherwise the plain folder name.
 *
 * `repoName` is best-effort (see `WorktreeProbe`): a project whose repo hasn't
 * been resolved yet falls back to (3) and upgrades on the next snapshot, so
 * this must never render an empty string while it waits.
