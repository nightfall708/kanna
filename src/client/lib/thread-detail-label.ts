 * - **Cross-project** → the project, because that's what tells two rows apart.
 *   Named by `formatProjectSidebarLabel`, so it picks up repo/branch.
 * - **Project-scoped** → the chat's age, because the project is already on the
 *   header above and would just repeat down the whole list.
 *
 * Call sites pass a *scope*, not a label. That's the point: a new surface can't
 * quietly invent a third policy, and improving either answer — the way
 * repo/branch arrived — reaches every surface at once instead of the one that
 * happened to get edited. `ThreadRowContent` takes `detailLabel` as a required
 * prop for the same reason: there is no implicit default to fall through to.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there's nothing worth showing, which renders as an empty
 * slot rather than a gap in the layout.
