/**
 * Height estimates for the virtualized transcript, per row.
 *
 * Transcript rows are strongly bimodal: most are collapsed tool headers around
 * 40px, while user prompts and assistant answers run from one line to well over
 * a thousand pixels. A single `estimatedItemSize` cannot describe both, and the
 * list's own fallback — averaging measured rows — converges on a number that is
 * wrong for every row rather than right for any.
 *
 * The cost of a bad estimate is not just wasted layout: unmeasured rows are
 * assumed to be the estimate, so `scrollToIndex` computes its target from it.
 * Restoring to a row a few hundred entries up lands in the wrong place and then
 * visibly settles as real sizes arrive. These numbers only need to be close
 * enough that the first pass is nearly right; the list replaces each one with a
 * real measurement as the row renders.
