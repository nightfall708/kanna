/**
 * A project's name as the sidebar shows it: the repo, prefixed with a branch
 * glyph when the project is on a branch worth flagging.
 *
 * This used to read `repo/branch`, which spent the widest part of a very narrow
 * slot on the least scannable half — at sidebar width a long branch name pushed
 * the repo into an ellipsis, so the one thing that tells two rows apart was the
 * first to go. The glyph says "not on main" in a fixed 12px; the branch itself,
 * with its owner and everything else about the chat, is in the hover card
 * (`ChatHoverCard`).
 *
 * Takes `ref` and spreads the rest so it can be a Radix `asChild` trigger — the
 * Projects-tab header uses it as one.
