 * *which* chat this is and *where it got to* has been squeezed out of it: the
 * branch, the harness, how long the turn has been running, what you asked and
 * what came back. The card is where that goes, on the one interaction that
 * costs nothing to attempt and nothing to dismiss.
 *
 * The two messages it shows are also the two places in the chat you most often
 * want to be, so both are clickable: the prompt lands you on the question, the
 * reply on the answer. It stays instant despite now being a target — the peek
 * is the point, and the cost is real but small: a cursor crossing the sidebar
 * raises cards it doesn't want, and briefly puts one over the transcript.
 *
 * Desktop only — hover is not a gesture touch has, and a tap-to-reveal card
 * would fight the row's tap.
