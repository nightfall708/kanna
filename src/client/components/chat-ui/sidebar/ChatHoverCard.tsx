 * what came back. The card is where that goes, on the one interaction that
 * costs nothing to attempt and nothing to dismiss.
 *
 * Deliberately instant (no open delay) and read-only: it's a peek while the
 * cursor travels the list, not a menu you aim for. Desktop only — hover is not
 * a gesture touch has, and a tap-to-reveal card would fight the row's tap.
