/**
 * The shared parts of the two cards that describe a turn on hover — the

 *
 * They answer the same question about the same thing ("what was asked here,
 * what came back, and when"), differing only in which turn they found and what
 * else they have room to say, so the pieces that carry that answer live here
 * and both cards assemble them. Keeping them in one place is what stops the two
 * readings of one fact from drifting into two different-looking facts.

/**
 * The horizontal inset every row of a card carries, paired with a card whose
 * own padding is the other half.
 *
 * Split that way because one row — the message blocks — has a hover fill, and a
 * fill that stops where the text starts reads as a box bolted onto the line
 * rather than a band you can hit. Paying for it with negative margins on a
 * `w-full` element does not work: the width resolves against the parent's
 * content box and the margins then push both edges outward, so the fill
 * overhangs the card. Giving the padding to the rows and taking it off the card
 * puts every line at the same optical inset with nothing overhanging.
 *
 * A card using these rows therefore wants `px-1.5` of its own, not `px-3`.
