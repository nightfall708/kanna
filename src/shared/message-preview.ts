/**
 * The one way Kanna turns a message into a one-line preview.
 *
 * Hover cards show messages at two or three clamped lines, and the raw text is
 * written for a renderer that isn't there: a prompt that opens with a heading
 * spends its first line on `##`, a reply full of `**bold**` reads as asterisk
 * soup, and a fenced block contributes a line of backticks. What the reader
 * wants from a preview is the sentence, so this returns the sentence.
 *
 * Two jobs, in this order — unwrap the markup, then flatten the lines. They are
 * one function because doing either alone gives a wrong answer: flattening
 * first glues list markers into the middle of the text where the line-start
 * rules can no longer see them.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a markdown parser. It is a lossy pass over the constructs
 * that actually show up at the head of a message, tuned to never mangle prose:
 * where a rule would risk eating real text — `snake_case` names, a bare `*`,
 * an XML-ish tag an agent wrote on purpose — it leaves the text alone. Being a
 * little under-stripped is invisible; eating a word is not.
