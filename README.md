# Kanna

Local-only desktop chat UI for Claude Code.

Point it at a folder, open the app locally, and work in multiple persistent chats tied to that project. No auth. No cloud sync. No hosted database. Just you, your code, and Claude.

## Overview

Kanna is a full-stack TypeScript application that gives you a rich, persistent chat interface for working with the Claude Agent SDK. It runs entirely on your machine — a Bun-powered backend manages state via event sourcing while a React frontend delivers a fluid, real-time experience over WebSockets.

Think of it as a local workbench: you open a project folder, spin up as many chat sessions as you like, and Claude can read, write, and reason about your code through agentic tool use. Every message, every tool call, every plan review is persisted locally as an append-only event log, so your history survives restarts, refreshes, and power outages.

## Features

- **Project-first sidebar** — chats grouped under projects, with status indicators (idle, running, waiting, failed)
- **Local project discovery** — auto-discovers projects from `~/.claude/projects`
- **Rich transcript rendering** — user messages, assistant responses, collapsible tool call groups, plan mode dialogs, and interactive prompts
- **Plan mode** — review and approve agent plans before execution
- **Persistent local history** — refresh-safe routes backed by JSONL event logs and compacted snapshots
- **Auto-generated titles** — chat titles generated in the background via Claude Haiku
- **Session resumption** — resume agent sessions with full context preservation
- **WebSocket-driven** — real-time subscription model with reactive state broadcasting

## Architecture

```
Browser (React + Zustand)
    ↕  WebSocket
Bun Server (HTTP + WS)
    ├── WSRouter ─── subscription & command routing
    ├── AgentCoordinator ─── Claude Agent SDK turn management
    ├── EventStore ─── JSONL persistence + snapshot compaction
    └── ReadModels ─── derived views (sidebar, chat, projects)
    ↕  stdio
Claude Agent SDK (local process)
    ↕
Local File System (~/.kanna/data/, project dirs)
```

**Key patterns:** Event sourcing for all state mutations. CQRS with separate write (event log) and read (derived snapshots) paths. Reactive broadcasting — subscribers get pushed fresh snapshots on every state change. Agent coordination with tool gating for user-approval flows.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- A working Claude Agent SDK environment

## Install

```bash
bun install
```

## Run

```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

Or use the CLI directly:

```bash
kanna
```

Flags:

```bash
bun run start -- --no-open
bun run start -- --port 4000
```

Default URL: `http://localhost:3210`

## Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

Or run client and server separately:

```bash
bun run dev:client   # http://localhost:5174
bun run dev:server   # http://localhost:3211
```

## Scripts

| Command              | Description                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `bun run build`      | Build for production         |
| `bun run check`      | Typecheck + build            |
| `bun run dev`        | Run client + server together |
| `bun run dev:client` | Vite dev server only         |
| `bun run dev:server` | Bun backend only             |
| `bun run start`      | Start production server      |

## Data

All state is stored locally at `~/.kanna/data/`:

| File             | Purpose                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `projects.jsonl` | Project open/remove events                |
| `chats.jsonl`    | Chat create/rename/delete events          |
| `messages.jsonl` | Transcript message entries                |
| `turns.jsonl`    | Agent turn start/finish/cancel events     |
| `snapshot.json`  | Compacted state snapshot for fast startup |

Event logs are append-only JSONL. On startup, Kanna replays the log tail after the last snapshot, then compacts if the logs exceed 2 MB.
